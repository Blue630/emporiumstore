                        <strong>7. Liability and Disclaimers</strong><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.1 Nothing on Our Site constitutes actual advice on which you should rely. It is provided for information purposes only. If you are unsure whether
                        our Services meet your needs, professional or specialist advice should always be sought before taking any action on the basis of any information provided on Our Site.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.2 We act only as a Conduit
                        platform bringing together the Advertisers and searchers. We are not contractually bound or connected if you rent, lease or hire any accommodation from an Advertiser. Nor for any arrangements or requirements or disputes or incidents,
                        between the Advertiser, Property owner or Customer/ Hirer. You hereby agree not to hold us responsible for anything that individual Users of our site post, advertise or do.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.3 Although we have
                        no obligation to monitor the information posted on our site, we do encourage any possible infringements, causes for concern or complaints/ corrections to be reported to us via our Contact Us page, so we can take appropriate action
                        where necessary.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.4 We have not personally vetted the facilities or premises advertised. Whilst we require proof of ownership of the property and the right to rent it from Advertisers, we cannot
                        vouch that such property is exactly suited to a Customer&rsquo;s needs. We recommend that all Advertisers and Customers put in place and conduct their own due diligence and safety/ comfort checks to ensure they are happy with any
                        arrangement between them. You should exercise the same due caution that you would in any circumstance or renting or hiring a property/ accommodation.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.5 Insofar as is permitted by law, We make
                        no representation, warranty, or guarantee that Our Site will meet your requirements, that it will not infringe the rights of third parties, that it will be compatible with all software and hardware, or that it will be secure.<br

                        more information.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.7 To the fullest extent permissible by law, We accept no liability to any User for any loss or damage, whether foreseeable or otherwise, in contract, tort (including negligence),

                        If you are a business user, we hereby exclude all implied conditions, warranties, representations or other terms that may apply to Our Site or Content. We will not be liable for any loss of profits, sales, business or revenue;
                        loss of business opportunity, goodwill or reputation; loss of anticipated savings; business interruption; or for any indirect or consequential loss or damage.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.9 If you are a Consumer user,
                        please note that Our Site is mostly intended for business use. If you have an enquiry as an individual Consumer then you should contact us directly with any request/s.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.10 We neither assume
                        nor accept responsibility or liability arising out of any disruption or non-availability of Our Site resulting from external causes beyond our reasonable control including, but not limited to, ISP equipment failure, host equipment
                        failure, communications network failure, natural events, strikes, acts of war, government legislation, pandemic or lockdown restrictions or other Force Majeure legal restrictions. In line with the foregoing, in the event of Us
                        not being able to fulfil any pre-paid advertisement period, Advertisers agree that a full refund of the remaining Advertising period by Us, shall act as full and final settlement sum in respect of any unused period so affected.<br
                        /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.11 Nothing in these Terms excludes or restricts Our liability for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation, for death or personal injury resulting from negligence, or for any other forms of liability
                        which cannot be excluded or restricted by law.<br />
