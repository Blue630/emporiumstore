<b>How to identify fake fur from animal fur</b>
<li>If you list fake fur-trimmed products, check that the material is actually fake. The three tests below will help you determine whether fur is real or fake. This guide is not intended as a substitute for professional testing by experts in order to comply with applicable laws or for other reasons.</li>
<li><b>Check the base of the fur for skin or fabric.</b> Push apart the fur and look at the material at the base of the hairs. If the base material is not visible or otherwise still unclear, and you own the garment, break the stitching and look at the non-hair side of the fur base, being sure to peel away all layers of lining.
	<ol>
	<li><b>ANIMAL FUR:</b> The surest sign of animal fur is leather/skin (usually white or tan, but possibly the colour of the fur if it has been dyed).</li>
	<li><b>FAKE FUR:</b> The surest sign of fake fur is seeing the threadwork backing from which the “hairs” emerge.</li>
	<li><b>Check the tips of the hairs</b> for tapering. Both animal fur and fake fur come in many different colors and lengths. However, if animal fur has not been sheared or cut to a uniform length or had the guard hairs plucked out, you may be able to examine the tips of the longest hairs and see that they taper into a fine point, like a cat's whisker or sewing needle. Good lighting and a magnifying glass are helpful, as is holding the hairs up against a white surface.</li>
	<li><b>The Burn Test.</b> Fake fur made from acrylic or polyester, the two most commonly used synthetics, smells like molten plastic. Carefully remove just a few hairs and then, holding them with tweezers above a dish or other non-flammable surface, ignite them with a cigarette lighter. Make sure to burn them away from the original garment and anything else flammable. Never conduct the burn test on hairs still attached to the garment. Only adults should conduct the burn test.</li>
	</ol>
</li>
<p>       <b>Please note:</b> Sellers who list prohibited items can have their selling permissions removed,
       either temporarily or permanently.</p>

You should refer to current UK Brexit guidance about your products (see below) to learn more about changes that may affect you following the end of the transition period.</p>
<p><strong>EU Requirements</strong></p>
<p>You are generally permitted to sell electronics products in the EU that (1) are legal for sale, (2) comply with the relevant legislation, (3) do not interfere with other electronics, and (4) where applicable, are marked (including with the CE mark).</p>
<p><strong>UK Requirements</strong></p>
<p>You are generally permitted to sell electronics products in the UK that (1) are legal for sale, (2) comply with the relevant legislation, (3) do not interfere with other electronics, and (4) where applicable, are marked (including with the CE or UKCA marks).</p>
<p>Please note that different rules will apply from 1 January 2021 in (1) Great Britain (England, Scotland, Wales, &ldquo;<strong>GB</strong>&rdquo;) and (2) Northern Ireland (&ldquo;<strong>NI</strong>&rdquo;), as a result of the Northern Ireland Protocol.</p>
<p><strong>Northern Ireland</strong></p>
<p>For products sold in NI:</p>
<p>You should ensure that products meet EU requirements and that you use the CE mark.</p>
<p>You are an importer established in the EU or NI and you sell products from a country outside of the EU and Northern Ireland (including from GB) into NI. Products sold in NI should be marked with details of any EU / NI based importer.</p>
<p>Authorised representatives can be based in NI or the EU. From 16 July 2021, new rules come into force under EU Regulation 2019/1020 and some businesses may need to appoint a responsible person in the EU or NI to carry out compliance functions (if there is other entity in the supply chain who is able to carry out the functions). Further guidance on the new rules will be made available by the UK Government.</p>
<p>If you are using a UK body to carry out mandatory third-party conformity assessment, you will need to apply a UKNI marking as well as a CE mark to products placed in NI from 1 January 2021. Goods with the CE and UKNI marking can&rsquo;t be sold in the EU. You do not need to use the UKNI marking if you self-certify compliance or use an EU body to carry out a mandatory third-party assessment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Qualifying Northern Ireland goods&rdquo; will be able to be sold in GB with the CE mark. The UK Government is issuing guidance on how this will work.</p>

<p><strong>Northern Ireland</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Please note that different rules will apply in NI from January 1, 2021, as a result of the Northern Ireland Protocol. In particular:</li>
<li>You should ensure that products meet EU requirements and that you use the CE mark.</li>
<li>You are an importer if you are established in the EU or NI and you sell products from a country outside of the EU and Northern Ireland (including from GB) into NI. Products sold in NI should be marked with details of any EU / NI based importer.</li>
<li>Authorised representatives can be based in NI or the EU. From July 16, 2021, new rules come into force under EU Regulation 2019/1020 and some businesses may need to appoint a responsible person in the EU or NI to carry out compliance functions (if there is other entity in the supply chain who is able to carry out the functions). Further guidance on the new rules will be made available by the UK Government.</li>
<li>If you are using a UK body to carry out mandatory third-party conformity assessment, you will need to apply a UKNI marking as well as a CE mark to products placed in NI from January 1, 2021. Goods with the CE and UKNI marking can&rsquo;t be sold in the EU. You do not need to use the UKNI marking if you self-certify compliance or use an EU body to carry out a mandatory third-party assessment.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Qualifying Northern Ireland goods&rdquo; will be able to be sold in GB with the CE mark. The UK Government is issuing guidance on how this will work.</li>

<p><strong>Examples of permitted listings</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Note: All listings and products must comply with all applicable laws and regulations.</li>
<li>You must be approved by Emporium to sell in these categories:</li>
<li>Jewellery</li>
<li>Gems</li>
<li>Precious metals (gold, silver, platinum and palladium) with the required hallmarks. Sale of precious metals over 1gm must be by weight.</li>

<li>Precious metals over 1gm which have not been weighed with stamped weighing and measuring equipment with the required degree of accuracy.</li>
<li>Rough diamonds that do not comply with the Kimberley Process (KP) Certification Scheme.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: Sellers who list prohibited items or content can have their selling permissions removed, either temporarily or permanently.</p>

<p><strong>Hallmarking requirements</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Local hallmark legislation for precious metals applies and must be respected in order to sell jewellery.</li>
<li>All precious metal (gold, silver, platinum and palladium) jewellery products must be marked with an approved hallmark, which is a physical mark stamped on the product specifying its standard of purity&nbsp;unless it falls within a specific exemption.</li>
<li>Visual advertisements or technical promotional material of jewelry products must only use descriptions of hallmarks equivalent to the hallmark legally attributable to the product in question.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Gold jewellery products cannot be described as &ldquo;8 carat gold&rdquo;, &ldquo;10 carat gold&rdquo;, &ldquo;333&rdquo; or similar as these are not recognised finesses of gold in the UK.</li>
<li>UK hallmarking authorities recognise EEA hallmarks applied prior to January 1, 2020, the &lsquo;common control mark&rsquo; and UK hallmarks.</li>
<li>Failure to comply with hallmarking legislation can lead to sanctions, including a fine and/or imprisonment.</li>
<li>In the case of plated products, the word &ldquo;plated&rdquo; must be followed by the name of the base metal. For example, &ldquo;A gold-plated brass necklace&rdquo;.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note:&nbsp;If a product does not contain the minimum percentage of the relevant precious metal (for example, silver, gold, platinum) required to be labelled as such, the title of the ASIN&nbsp;must not&nbsp;describe a product as &ldquo;gold&rdquo; or &ldquo;silver&rdquo;. Descriptions such as &ldquo;gold color&rdquo;, &ldquo;gold-plated&rdquo; or &ldquo;gold tone&rdquo; must be used if the minimum percentage of the relevant precious metal is not met.&nbsp;</p>

Cancellation by email or by post is effective from the date on which the Buyer sends you their message. Please note that the cooling-off period lasts for whole calendar days. If, for example, the Buyer sends you an email or letter by 23:59:59 on the final day of the cooling-off period, their cancellation will be valid and must be accepted.</li>
<li>Items must be returned to you by the Buyer no more than 14 calendar days after the day on which the Buyer informs you that they wish to cancel. The Buyer will be responsible for the costs of returning items to you if they cancel under the cooling-off period.</li>
<li>When a Buyer cancels under the cooling-off period, you must issue a refund within 14 calendar days of the following:
<ol>
<li>The day on which you receive the item(s) back; or</li>

You must bear the costs and must carry out the repair or replacement within a reasonable time and without significant inconvenience to the Buyer.</li>

<li>You may only use another User&rsquo;s personal data for additional purposes with their express consent.</li>
<li>If any Seller and Us are found to be joint data controllers of any Buyers&rsquo; personal data, and We are sued, fined, or otherwise incur any expense because of something you have done with a Buyer&rsquo;s personal data, you agree to indemnify Us for any expenses incurred by Us in connection with your actions in respect of that personal data.
