			<li><b>Access to Our Site & Account Registration</b>
			<ol>
			
			<li>Access to Our Site is free of charge.</li>
			<li>It is your responsibility to make any and all arrangements necessary in order to access Our Site.</li>
			<li>Access to Our Site is provided “as is” and on an “as available” basis.  We may alter, suspend or discontinue Our Site (or any part of it) at any time and without notice.  We will not be liable to you in any way if Our Site (or any part of it) is unavailable at any time and for any period.</li>
			<li>Users will be able to access the majority of this Website without having to register any details with us. However, particular areas of this Website will only be accessible if you have registered, including the ability to use our services.</li>
			<li>Advertising & Fees – Prior to acceptance of any advertising for properties, we require sight of official documentation proving that you are the owner of the property and have the right to offer short term accommodation and/or holiday lets. You should refer to our acceptable documents list for further information. We regret that without this evidence being in place, we will be unable to accept your advertisement or feature listing.</li>
			<li>You are solely responsible for all information that you submit to Us and any consequences that may result from your post or advert for your accommodation or property. Any and all information in your advertisement/s must meet the required UK legal standards for any advertising featured or the details therein. We reserve the right to refuse any advertising, or moderate/ amend any advertising that breaches the required standards.</li>
			<li>We also reserve the right to restrict your account and advertising on our site either temporarily or permanently, if you continue to breach the required standards regarding advertising law. This could have the subsequent result that you shall forfeit any monies paid for any current or future advertising, which you acknowledge and understand and agree to.</li>
			<li>Other than any specified free trial period, UK Shortlets.com fees are those as specified under the “Ad Costs” and “Buy” tools header. Payment is currently made using Paypal, Stripe. We do not become involved with, not have access to or store any of your financial information during the purchase process, so as to further protect your privacy. We regret that at this time, if you do not have a Paypal, Stripe account we cannot post your advertisement. Please note that you will be subject to Paypal’s, Stripe Privacy Policy & Terms of Use during your transaction and it is recommended that you refer to them to ensure you agree with them.</li>
			<li>Since all advertising is considered a bespoke purchase under law, all advertising fees are due in advance of being featured on Our Site, and as such are exempt from any refunds or replacements, once they have been booked and authorised. Only if the advertisement contains errors caused by our negligence shall they be replaced, extended or refunded. If the advert is cancelled or you end your membership with Us, then any pre-paid advertising will be refunded after the date of your cancellation or termination.</li>
